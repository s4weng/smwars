Stickman Wars
====

Written in **C++** and utilizing [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/).

The concept of this game is turn-based attacking, with the goal of destroying/killing the other players.

Players will be able to move around the map before selecting their weapon of choice (melee/magic/range) and attacking the other players. If the player hits another target, they will deal damage based on their weapon choice (and possibly other factors). When a player's health points hit 0, they will be taken out of the game until the round is over (one player remains).

Basic to-do list:
- basic attack functionality
  - human
  - AI
- multiple human player support
- multiple AI support

Required Graphical Tasks:
- Sprites with transparent background
- Background items for maps (e.g., mountains, trees, snow, etc.)
- Weapons (sword, staff, bow and arrows)
- Animations for attacks (shooting spells, shooting arrows, swinging sword)
